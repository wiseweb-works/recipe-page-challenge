## About The Project

The **Recipe Page** challenge focuses on writing semantic HTML and CSS by selecting the most appropriate elements for each piece of content. The goal is to create a visually appealing and accessible recipe page that adheres to modern web standards.

Your users should be able to:

- View the recipe details in a well-structured format.
- Enjoy a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

This project does not require JavaScript, making it an excellent practice for working with pure HTML and CSS.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility best practices

## What I learned

This project emphasized the importance of semantic HTML and choosing the correct tags for different types of content. Additionally, I improved my CSS skills by working on layout techniques using Flexbox and Grid. Accessibility was a key focus throughout the development process.

## Useful resources

1. [HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - A great resource for learning about semantic HTML tags.
2. [CSS Grid Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Helped me better understand grid-based layouts.
3. [WebAIM: Accessibility Resources](https://webaim.org/) - Provided useful tips for improving accessibility.
